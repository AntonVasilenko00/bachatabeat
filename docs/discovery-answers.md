# Discovery Answers — Bachata Music Analyzer

---

## Idea and one-liner

- **One-liner:** A web app where bachata dancers, teachers, and DJs can link their Spotify (and later YouTube / Apple Music), add songs by link, listen to them in-app, manually annotate the full song structure (sync counts, breaks, accents, rhythm changes, sections), store breakdowns in a database, and browse a community catalog of analyzed songs with their breakdowns.
- **Single most important thing:** Give the bachata community a shared, structured breakdown of every song — counts, breaks, sections — so anyone can learn, teach, or DJ with confidence.
- **Tagline ideas:** (to be generated in name-and-domain phase)

## Problem and pain

- **Whose problem:** Bachata dancers (social and performance), teachers/instructors, and DJs.
- **What's broken today:** There is no existing resource that breaks down bachata songs by structure and timing. Dancers learn timing by ear or from a teacher in class, but there's nothing to reference later. Teachers prepare breakdowns ad-hoc, often just in their heads. DJs pick songs without a structured view of where breaks and transitions happen.
- **Current workarounds:** Dancers rely on memory from class, teachers count out loud, DJs preview songs manually. Some write notes on paper or in spreadsheets, but nothing is standardized or shareable.
- **Why workarounds fall short:** No playback integration, no community sharing, no visual timeline. Notes are personal and unstructured.
- **How often:** Every class, every social, every practice session — multiple times a week for active dancers/teachers.
- **Cost:** Time spent re-learning song structure, teachers repeating the same breakdown, dancers not being able to practice at home because they can't remember timing.

## Target audience and segment

- **Primary user:** All of the above — social bachata dancers, performance/competition dancers, teachers/instructors, DJs.
- **Niche first:** Bachata community specifically (not salsa, not kizomba — bachata first).
- **Geography:** Global, English-first.
- **Where they hang out:** Bachata festivals, social dance events, Instagram/TikTok dance community, Facebook bachata groups, YouTube bachata channels, WhatsApp/Telegram dancer groups.
- **What they trust:** Well-known bachata teachers, festival organizers, popular YouTube channels (e.g. bachata tutorial creators).

## Solution and differentiation

- **Core mechanism:** User links Spotify account, pastes a song link, app resolves the song and enables in-app playback. While listening, user manually annotates the song timeline: marking sync counts (1-2-3-tap), breaks, accents, rhythm changes, and section boundaries (intro, verse, chorus, bridge, outro). The annotated breakdown is saved in the database and becomes available in the community catalog.
- **Key differentiator:** Manual, human-curated breakdowns by dancers for dancers — not auto-generated by an algorithm. The breakdown speaks the language of bachata (counts, taps, breaks) rather than generic music analysis terms.
- **Not building in v1:** AI/auto beat detection (future roadmap), mobile app (web-first), YouTube and Apple Music integration (Spotify first).
- **Must-have vs nice-to-have:** The community catalog of breakdowns is the must-have. Without it, it's just a personal note-taking tool.
- **User flow:** Sign up → Link Spotify → Paste song link → Song loads with playback → Annotate breakdown on timeline → Save → Song appears in community catalog → Other users browse, find song, listen with breakdown overlay.

## Market and category

- **Category:** Music analysis / dance education tool for the bachata community.
- **Market:** Niche within dance tech / music education. Bachata is one of the most popular partner dances globally with a growing international scene (festivals, schools, socials on every continent).
- **Growing or shrinking:** Growing — bachata has exploded in popularity over the last 5–10 years; new schools, festivals, and online content are appearing constantly.
- **Regulations:** Music licensing (Spotify API ToS, playback restrictions); GDPR for EU users. No HIPAA or heavy compliance.

## Competitors and alternatives

- **Direct competitors:** None known that specifically do bachata song structure breakdowns with playback integration.
- **Indirect competitors / alternatives:** Generic music analysis tools (e.g. Chordify, Songsterr — but these are for chords/tabs, not dance timing), personal notes/spreadsheets, YouTube videos where teachers break down songs verbally, BPM counter apps.
- **Gap:** No product combines in-app playback + manual dancer-specific annotation + community catalog for any dance genre, let alone bachata specifically.
- **Real competitor research:** To be done with user confirmation (browse, pricing, positioning).

---

## Trends and timing

- **Why now:** Bachata's global growth, rise of online dance education (accelerated by COVID), creator economy in dance (teachers monetizing content), and music API accessibility (Spotify, YouTube APIs are mature).
- **Real trends research:** To be done with user confirmation (Google Trends, search).

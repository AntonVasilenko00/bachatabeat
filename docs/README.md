# bachata-music-analyzer

This folder contains the planning output for the idea: **BachataBeat** — a web app where bachata dancers, teachers, and DJs can link Spotify, add songs by link, manually annotate song structure (counts, breaks, accents, sections), and browse a community catalog of analyzed songs.

Copy this entire folder into a new workspace to work on the project in isolation. Output files are written by the planning agents; see `.cursor/rules/output-and-orchestration.mdc` in the main repo for the file list and section mapping.

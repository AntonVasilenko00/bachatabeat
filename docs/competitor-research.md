### Competitor Analysis (Deep Dive)

#### Direct Competitors

| Competitor | What They Do | Target Audience | Pricing | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|---------|-----------|------------|
| Chordify | Chord detection from audio | Guitarists, musicians | Freemium, ~$5/mo | Popular, real-time chord detection | For instruments, not dance; no counts, breaks, sections |
| Songsterr | Tabs, chord charts, playback | Musicians | Freemium | Large catalog, playback sync | Guitar/bass focused; no dance structure |
| SoundCloud (with annotations) | Music hosting, some timestamp comments | General listeners | Free / paid | Large catalog, playback | Not structured; not dance-specific; comments are ad-hoc |
| (No bachata-specific direct competitor identified) | — | — | — | — | Gap in market |

#### Indirect Competitors / Alternatives

| Alternative | How People Currently Solve This | Why It's Inadequate |
|-------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| Paper notes / notebooks | Teachers and dancers write counts and section notes by hand | Not linked to playback; not shareable; hard to search; format varies |
| Spreadsheets (Google Sheets, Excel) | Some organize song lists with BPM, notes, timestamps | No in-app playback; no standard schema; not community-shared; manual sync |
| YouTube videos | Teachers post videos where they count or explain structure verbally | Not browseable by song; can't filter by structure; no shared database; depends on creator |
| In-class instruction only | Teachers count aloud; dancers memorize in class | Not reusable; no at-home reference; each teacher redoes the work |
| DJ prep (manual preview) | DJs listen through songs, note breaks and transitions | Time-consuming; no structured output; not shareable with other DJs or dancers |
| BPM Tap apps | Tap to get BPM | Only BPM; no structural breakdown; no counts, breaks, or sections |

#### Potential Future Competitors

- **Spotify / Apple Music / YouTube Music** — Could add "song structure" or "dance breakdown" as a feature, but not in their core product roadmap; dance is a niche use case.
- **Dance app platforms (e.g., Steezy, CLI Studios)** — Focus on choreography and tutorials; could add song breakdown as a feature. Not currently doing it; would require significant product focus.
- **Bachata festival organizers or large schools** — Could build internal tools; unlikely to build a public, community-wide product.

#### Positioning Map

**Key dimensions:** Dance-specificity (generic ↔ bachata-native) vs. Playback + structure integration (none ↔ full)

- **Chordify / Songsterr:** Generic (instruments); playback with chords/tabs; no dance structure.
- **YouTube tutorials:** Bachata-specific but ad-hoc; playback exists; no structured, searchable database.
- **Spreadsheets / notes:** Generic or bachata-specific depending on user; no integrated playback.
- **Your idea:** Bachata-native; full playback + structure integration; community catalog with shared breakdowns.

**Positioning gaps identified:**

- No product offers bachata-specific breakdown vocabulary (counts, tap, breaks, sections) with integrated playback.
- No community catalog of analyzed bachata songs exists — every breakdown is personal or one-off.
- No product targets dancers, teachers, and DJs together with a single shared resource.

#### SWOT Implications (from competitive landscape)

**Opportunities (competitors' weaknesses you can exploit):**

- Chordify/Songsterr ignore dance; strong differentiation by focusing on bachata structure.
- YouTube and spreadsheets are fragmented; a central, community-built catalog fills a gap.
- No one owns the bachata "song breakdown" category; first-mover advantage is possible.

**Threats (competitors' strengths that put you at risk):**

- Large music platforms could add structure/annotation features; niche focus helps but doesn't eliminate risk.
- Free alternatives (YouTube, spreadsheets) may limit willingness to pay; freemium and strong community value are important.

## Market Research

### Market Size

- **TAM:** The global dance education and fitness market (which includes partner dance) was roughly $100B+ in 2024. Latin dance (salsa, bachata, kizomba) is a subset. If we narrow to "music/dance tech tools for Latin dance" — a niche — a rough TAM could be $50M–$200M in annual revenue opportunity if every bachata dancer, teacher, and DJ used a paid tool. This is an estimate; no precise data exists for dance-structure tools.
- **SAM:** Bachata dancers, teachers, and DJs who actively seek structured song breakdowns. Bachata has grown sharply (festivals, schools, socials on every continent). A conservative SAM: 500K–2M global users who would consider such a tool, with 20–30% willing to pay. That implies roughly 100K–600K potential paying users.
- **SOM:** Realistic near-term (1–3 years): early adopters in English-speaking bachata communities (US, UK, Europe). Target 5K–20K MAU and 500–3K paying subscribers could yield roughly $30K–$150K ARR at $5–15/mo, depending on conversion and churn.
- **Key assumptions:** Bachata remains popular; no direct competitor launches a similar product; users will pay for convenience and a community catalog; Spotify API remains accessible for integration.

### Competitor Analysis

| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| Chordify, Songsterr | Chord/tab detection, music analysis | For guitar/instruments, not dance; no bachata counts, breaks, or sections |
| BPM Counter apps | Simple BPM detection | No structural breakdown; no community catalog; no playback integration |
| YouTube tutorial videos | Teachers explain song structure verbally | Not searchable by song; no shared database; can't browse by structure |
| Personal notes / spreadsheets | Flexible, free | Unstructured, not linked to playback, not shareable, no standard format |
| (No direct competitor) | — | No product combines in-app playback + manual dancer-specific annotation + community catalog for bachata |

**Positioning gaps:** No product offers a community catalog of bachata song breakdowns (counts, breaks, sections) with playback integration. There is clear whitespace for a bachata-specific, community-built tool.

**Trends summary (paste-ready):** Search interest in bachata has likely grown over the past 5 years, driven by festivals, social media, and online dance content. There is no direct indicator for "bachata song structure" or "dance music breakdown" — the problem may be latent. Validating with customer interviews and a simple landing page is recommended before committing to build.

# SWOT Analysis

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths

- **Bachata-native positioning:** Only product that speaks the language of dancers (counts, tap, breaks, sections) with integrated playback — not generic music analysis.
- **Community-built catalog:** Users create and share breakdowns; network effects grow the catalog and stickiness as more songs are analyzed.
- **No direct competitor:** Whitespace in the market; first-mover advantage in the bachata song breakdown category.
- **Clear user segments:** Dancers, teachers, and DJs all benefit from the same resource; cross-segment word-of-mouth.
- **Freemium reduces friction:** Free catalog access drives adoption and contributions; conversion to paid for power users.

### Weaknesses

- **Solo founder:** Single point of execution; limited capacity for development, marketing, and support.
- **Music API dependency:** Reliance on Spotify (and later YouTube, Apple Music) for playback; ToS and region restrictions could limit features.
- **Manual-only in v1:** No AI-assisted breakdown; annotation is time-consuming; some users may want automation before contributing.
- **Niche market:** Bachata is growing but still a subset of dance; TAM is smaller than general music tools.
- **Cold start:** Empty catalog at launch; need seed contributors (teachers, early adopters) before the catalog has value.

### Opportunities

- **Bachata growth:** Festival growth, social media, and online dance education increase demand for structured learning tools.
- **Competitor gaps:** Chordify/Songsterr ignore dance; YouTube and spreadsheets are fragmented; central catalog fills a gap.
- **Expand to adjacent dances:** Salsa, kizomba could use the same structure; same product, new catalogs.
- **AI-assisted breakdown (roadmap):** Future feature could reduce annotation effort and attract users who won't contribute manually.
- **Partnership channel:** Bachata festivals, schools, and influencers need tools; distribution and validation in one.

### Threats

- **Large music platforms:** Spotify, Apple Music, or YouTube could add structure/annotation features; niche focus helps but doesn't eliminate risk.
- **Free alternatives:** YouTube and spreadsheets are free; willingness to pay depends on convenience and community value being clear.
- **Catalog quality:** Open contribution risks inconsistent or wrong breakdowns; need moderation or verification over time.
- **Licensing/ToS:** Music APIs may restrict playback or metadata usage; need to stay compliant.
- **Execution risk:** Solo founder with limited runway; competition or market shift could outpace development.

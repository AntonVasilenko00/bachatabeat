## Validation

### Customer Interviews

**Who to interview:**

- **Bachata teachers/instructors** — Bachata schools, festivals, Instagram (search "bachata teacher"), Facebook groups (Bachata Teachers, Bachata Community), referrals from dancers
- **Social bachata dancers** — Local social dance events, Facebook bachata groups, r/bachata, Instagram/TikTok bachata community
- **Bachata DJs** — Festival DJs, DJ pages on Instagram, bachata DJ groups on Facebook, event organizers

**Key questions (Mom Test–compliant):**

- "When was the last time you needed to know the structure of a bachata song — where the breaks are, where to count — and what did you do?"
- "How often does this come up for you — weekly, monthly, or only sometimes?"
- "What do you currently use to remember or prepare song structure — notes, spreadsheets, memory, YouTube? Walk me through your process."
- "Have you tried any tools or methods for this and stopped? Why did you stop?"
- "How much time do you spend per week or month learning songs, preparing breakdowns, or trying to remember timing?"

**How to summarize feedback:**

| Interviewee | Key Feedback | Problem Confirmed? | Willingness to Pay? |
|-------------|--------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| [Name/role] | [1–2 sentence summary] | Yes / No / Partial | [Signal] |

### Waitlist

**When to set up:** Before any implementation — as soon as you have a name, one-liner, and landing page.

**How to set up:**

- Create a simple landing page (tools: Carrd, Typedream, Framer, Unbounce, or a single HTML page)
- Include: headline ("The bachata song breakdown catalog the community never had"), one-liner ("Add songs, annotate counts and breaks, browse a shared catalog. Made by dancers for dancers."), email capture form, clear CTA ("Join the waitlist" / "Get early access")
- Connect email capture to: Mailchimp, ConvertKit, Buttondown, or a simple Google Form → Sheet

**Metrics to track:**

- Landing page visitors → sign-up conversion rate (target: >10% = strong interest)
- Email open rate on follow-ups (target: >40%)
- Reply rate to follow-up questions (target: >10%)

### Pre-sell

**Why pre-sell:** A sign-up is interest; a payment is validation. Collecting money (or hard commitment) before building is the strongest signal.

**Pre-sell methods:**

- **Paid waitlist:** Charge a small fee ($5–$20) for priority access when the product launches. Tools: Gumroad, Stripe Payment Links, LemonSqueezy.
- **Pre-order / "Buy now":** Add a purchase button for a discounted early-bird annual price (e.g., $49/year instead of $99). Deliver when ready or refund if you don't build.
- **Manual / concierge sales:** Manually create breakdowns for 5–10 songs for the first 5–10 customers. Charge $20–50. Validates willingness to pay and demand for the catalog.
- **Letter of intent:** For teachers/DJs — get written commitment ("I would pay $X/mo for access to a catalog like this").

**Order of operations:**

1. Problem interviews (do people actually have this problem?)
2. Waitlist + landing page (does anyone care enough to sign up?)
3. Pre-sell (will anyone pay before it exists?)
4. → Only then: build.

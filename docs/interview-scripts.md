**How many:** 5–10 interviews minimum for initial problem validation. More if signals are mixed.

**How to recruit:**

- DM bachata teachers on Instagram: "Hi, I'm exploring how instructors prepare song breakdowns for class. Would you have 15 min to share your experience?"
- Ask event organizers at local bachata socials for intros to DJs or teachers.

#### Interview Script

**Opening (1–2 min):**

> "Thanks for taking the time. I'm trying to understand how people in the bachata community deal with song structure and timing — like counts, breaks, sections. I'm not selling anything; I just want to learn from your experience. There are no right or wrong answers."

**Problem Discovery (5–7 min):**

1. "Can you tell me about your role in the bachata world and what a typical week looks like when it comes to learning or teaching songs?"
2. "When was the last time you needed to know the structure of a bachata song — where the breaks are, where to count, etc.? Walk me through what happened."
3. "How often does this come up — daily, weekly, or only sometimes?"
4. "On a scale of 1–10, how annoying is it when you don't have a clear breakdown of a song, compared to other things you deal with?"
5. "What's the most frustrating part about figuring out or remembering song structure?"

**Current Behavior (3–5 min):**

6. "What do you do today when you need to learn or teach the structure of a song? Walk me through your process."
7. "Do you use any tools — apps, notes, spreadsheets, YouTube — or is it mostly in your head?"
8. "What works about your current approach? What doesn't?"

**Past Solutions (2–3 min):**

9. "Have you tried any other ways to solve this — apps, written notes, videos, anything?"
10. "If you tried something and stopped, why did you stop?"
11. "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about how you deal with song structure, what would it be?"

**Cost and Impact (2–3 min):**

12. "How much time do you spend per week or month on this — learning songs, preparing breakdowns, or trying to remember timing?"
13. "Has this ever cost you — missed practices, wrong timing in a performance, extra prep time?"
14. "If this problem went away tomorrow, what would change for you?"

**Commitment (1–2 min — end of interview):**

15. "If there were a tool that let you browse bachata songs with their structure already broken down — counts, breaks, sections — would that be useful to you?"
16. "Would you be open to trying an early version and giving feedback?"
17. "Do you know anyone else who deals with this that I should talk to?"

**Closing:**

> "This was really helpful, thank you. I may follow up if I have a few more questions. And I'll let you know if we build something based on what I'm learning."

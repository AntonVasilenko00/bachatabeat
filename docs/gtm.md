## Go-to-Market

### Pre-Build Marketing (Do This First)

#### Social Accounts to Create

**Instagram:**

- Handle: @bachatabeat (or chosen product name)
- Bio: "The bachata song breakdown catalog. Add songs, annotate counts & breaks, browse the community catalog. Link in bio for early access."
- Link in bio: [Waitlist/landing page URL]
- First 3–5 posts:
  1. Problem hook: "Ever forget the counts halfway through a song at social? You're not alone."
  2. Behind-the-scenes: "Building something for the bachata community. A shared catalog of song breakdowns — counts, breaks, sections."
  3. Social proof: "X people already signed up for early access. Join the waitlist."
  4. Value tip: "3 tips for remembering bachata song structure when practicing at home."
  5. Waitlist CTA: "Early access is live. Link in bio."

**Reddit:**

- Subreddits: r/bachata, r/Salsa, r/Dance, r/latin Dance
- Username: BachataBeat or founder handle
- Strategy: Provide genuine value (answer questions about song structure, timing, practice). Mention the product only when someone asks for a solution.
- First 3 posts/comments:
  1. Answer a question in r/bachata about learning song structure or counts.
  2. Post: "How do you remember song structure when practicing at home?" (research + awareness)
  3. Share waitlist when someone says they wish there was a tool for this.

**X (Twitter):**

- Handle: @bachatabeat
- Bio: "Building the bachata song breakdown catalog. Counts, breaks, sections — by dancers, for dancers. Join waitlist: [link]"
- Pinned tweet: "We're building BachataBeat: a shared catalog of bachata song breakdowns. Add songs, annotate counts & breaks, browse what others have done. Join early access: [link]"
- First 3–5 tweets:
  1. "The biggest pain in bachata: no shared resource for song structure. Teachers count aloud every class. Dancers rely on memory. We're fixing that."
  2. "Day 1 of building BachataBeat. Validating with bachata teachers, dancers, and DJs. DM if you want to chat."
  3. "Bachata 101: the tap is on 4. But where are the breaks? The chorus? Nobody has mapped this — until now."
  4. "Building BachataBeat for the bachata community. Join early access: [link]"
  5. "Dancers, teachers, DJs: how do you currently deal with song structure and timing? Reply below — I'm researching."

#### Waitlist CTA

- **One clear CTA:** "Join the waitlist" / "Get early access"
- **Landing page URL:** Same everywhere — bachatabeat.com or getbachatabeat.com
- **Every social bio, every post:** Link to waitlist

#### SEO Before Implementation

**Keyword research:**

- Primary: "bachata song structure"
- Secondary: "bachata counts", "bachata music breakdown", "learn bachata timing"
- Long-tail: "how to remember bachata song structure", "bachata song breakdown for teachers"

**Landing page SEO:**

- Title tag: BachataBeat — The Bachata Song Breakdown Catalog | Early Access
- Meta description: Add songs, annotate counts and breaks, browse a community catalog of bachata song breakdowns. Join early access — made by dancers for dancers.
- H1: The bachata song breakdown catalog the community never had

**Content hooks (1–2 before build):**

1. Blog: "How to Learn Bachata Song Structure (And Why It Matters)" — targets primary keyword, links to waitlist
2. Reddit/Quora answer: Answer "How do I remember bachata counts when practicing at home?" with value + link to waitlist

**Goal:** Start ranking and attracting organic interest before the product exists.

### Marketing Plan

**Primary channels (Bullseye inner ring):**

1. **Community / partnerships** — Bachata Facebook groups, Instagram, festivals. Partner with teachers and influencers.
2. **Content / SEO** — Problem-focused content, "bachata song structure" and related keywords.
3. **Social (Instagram, Reddit)** — Regular posts, engagement in bachata communities.

**Tactics per channel:**

- Community: Post in bachata groups, DM teachers/DJs, offer to create breakdowns for their favorite songs (concierge validation)
- Content: 1 blog post every 2 weeks targeting keywords; share on Reddit, Facebook, Twitter
- Social: 3–5 Instagram posts/week; participate in r/bachata without spamming

### Sales Strategy

- **Approach:** Product-led growth (PLG) + community. Free catalog drives sign-ups; conversion to paid happens when power users hit limits or want full tools.
- **Pre-build sales:** Pre-sell via paid waitlist or manual concierge breakdowns; validate willingness to pay.
- **Post-launch sales:** Convert waitlist with early-bird pricing; onboard teachers and DJs first (they drive catalog and referrals); use in-app prompts when free users hit limits.
- **Partnerships:** Bachata festivals (sponsor, booth, workshop), dance schools (bulk accounts, co-marketing), YouTube bachata channels (affiliate or featured tool).
